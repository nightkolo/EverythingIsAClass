# Everything Is a Class

This is a **Java** playground where I wrote and deploy basic applications in this programming language!

I am using [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) and as expected, migrating to a new environment and language is uncharted territory. I take this as a learning experience. I may leave my experiences in the form of code comments, with respect to my ability as an aspiring programmer and game engine user.

### Why The Repo

- **Learning Java** 
- **Experimentation**
- **Sharing my Journey, Anyhow**

## Project

In a directory, all source code is located under [`src/[project_name]`](Playground/src/playground/), minus the boilerplate files.

### Heads up

**I am not sure how to version with NetBeans**. Version control is work in progress. I assume there are also system-related files laying around that should be ignored. I've always been a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) developer (and probably searching "how to center div" for the millionth time). 

But I won't drop too deep into naviety, I know VScode is not the best editor in the world, although its community support (Extensions) is something I'll miss. But I'm an optimistic enough to explore what NetBeans has to offer.

Anyhow, take the repo with a grain of salt!
